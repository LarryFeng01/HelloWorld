  | Cats   | Description |
  | ------ | ----------- |
  | Stormy | Youngest. Full of energy and likes to mess around. Stays by the garage door to sneak out when it opens.|
  | Bella  | 2nd oldest. Used to be like Stormy. Now likes to sleep on top of air vents.|
  | Happy  | Eldest. Follows my dad everywhere. Hard to find since she's always sleeping.|
